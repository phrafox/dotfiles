These dotfiles are meant to be used with [i3wm](https://github.com/i3/i3) or [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3). 
Look down below for the correct symlink locations and dependencies per-file.

## DISCLAIMER
These files are not meant to just be copied and will **not** work if you just copy/paste them onto your system. 
The intention is to copy elements out of there and use them in your own configs;
